# üèóÔ∏è Kanban Board React Application

> **A powerful, interactive Kanban board built with React and TypeScript ‚Äî featuring drag-and-drop task management, modal task details, task creation, deletion, and advanced compound filtering.**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements a **Kanban board frontend** designed for efficient task management.  
It uses **React (TypeScript)** with **Vite** for fast builds, **NPM** as the package manager, and **Fluent UI** for design consistency.

You can **drag tasks between columns**, view detailed task information in modals, create new tasks via a form, delete tasks, and filter tasks dynamically using advanced **compound logic** (AND, OR, NOT) on **assignees** and **tags**.
